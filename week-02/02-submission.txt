Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/rdavis0/CSE341-node

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
    - Express.js installed and directing traffic
    - Added 404 page
    - Pages styled
    - Using EJS view engine
    - Partials served by ejs

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
    None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    Express.js really simplified the mechanics of Node. 
    I'm also glad to have EJS as a way to reuse portions of HTML. This is awesome since basic HTML doesn't support anything like that.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    Nothing

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   **4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
    I followed along with the videos and did everything there was to do. Looking forward to expanding the project to a point where there's more room for creativity.
