After completing the assignment, be sure to push to Github. You do not have to worry about pushing to Heroku this lesson.
Please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Copy and paste the URL for your source code repository (e.g., GitHub):
https://github.com/rdavis0/CSE341-node
https://cse341-rd.herokuapp.com/

3. Briefly list and describe the elements of the application that are functioning. 
    - Set up MongoDB
    - Refactored everything to use mongoose
    - Add products
    - Add to cart, view cart
    - Place order (clears cart)

4. Briefly describe any pieces of the assignment that are not yet working correctly.
    None

5. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    The concept of a NoSQL database is very slick. It's so flexible compared to a SQL database,
    yet with mogoose you can enforce some structure akin to a SQL database where useful. I'm looking
    forward to using MongoDB and mongoose in future projects to get up and running quickly.

6. If you could change this assignment to be more effective or helpful, what would you change?
    It was a lot to take in all at once. The workload increased significantly compared to previous weeks, especially
    with having to get the project running on Heroku AND adding the database to Heroku all at once.

7. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
   1 - Some attempt was made
   2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
   3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
   **4 - Meets requirements
   5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements

8. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
    I followed along with the videos and did everything there was to do.
